Adding a **Personal Number** allows your AI agents to use your own phone number for outbound calls. This step is especially useful for personalized campaigns or when you want to display a familiar number to the recipient.

### Step-by-step Process:

1. Go to the **Personal Numbers** tab on the left-hand menu.
2. Click **\+ Add Personal Number**.
3. Enter your number and select the country code.
4. Follow the **verification process**:
   - You’ll receive a call from Twilio.
   - Enter the provided verification code.
   - Once verified, your number will be added to your account.

> ⚠️ Make sure the number is active and accessible to complete the verification call.
