2. Click **+ Add Personal Number**.
3. Enter your number and select the country code.
4. Follow the **verification process**:
   - You’ll receive a call from Twilio.
   - Enter the provided verification code.
   - Once verified, your number will be added to your account.

> ⚠️ Make sure the number is active and accessible to complete the verification call.
