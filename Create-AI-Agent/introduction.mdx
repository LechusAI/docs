## Step 3: Choose a voice

In this step, you can select the voice your agent will use based on the previously selected language.

Each voice includes a short description (e.g., “Friendly conversational voice”, “American accent”) and a preview button that allows you to listen before making your choice.

Make sure to select a voice that fits the tone and purpose of your calls.

## Step 4: Advanced settings

This section allows you to configure optional features that improve call control and customization:

- **Machine Answering Detection**: Automatically detects voicemail and auto-responders.
- **Office Ambience Sound**: Adds simulated background noise to make the agent sound like it's in a real office.
- **Retry Settings**: Set the time interval between retries if a call is not answered (e.g., between 0 and 30 seconds).
- **Webhook URL**: Enter a URL to receive real-time events such as call results or transcripts.

## Step 5: Agent behavior and integrations

- **Agent Type**:
  - `Standard Agent`: Uses predefined prompts and categories.
  - `Knowledge-Based Agent`: Uses uploaded documents as a knowledge base.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Connect a calendar to enable appointment scheduling.

## Step 6: Define actions and messages

- **Call to Action**: Choose actions like scheduling appointments or transferring to a human agent.
- **Greeting Message**: The first message the AI will say.
- **Category**: Choose a theme for the conversation (e.g., e-commerce).
- **System Prompt**: The system-level instruction guiding the agent's behavior.
