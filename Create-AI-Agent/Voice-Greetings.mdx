The **Voice Cloning** interface allows you to personalize your AI agent’s voice by either recording a new voice or uploading an audio file.

### Voice Customization Options

You have two options:

- **Start Recording**: Record your voice directly from the browser.
- **Upload Audio**: Select a pre-recorded audio file in supported formats.

Both methods require a sample of at least **30 seconds** to ensure accurate cloning.

### Recording Guidelines

To achieve the best results:

- Record in a **quiet environment** with minimal background noise.
- **Speak clearly** and at a natural pace.
- Provide at least **30 seconds** of uninterrupted speech.
- Avoid background music or **multiple voices** in the sample.

This process is crucial to creating a realistic and personalized AI voice that reflects your brand’s tone.
