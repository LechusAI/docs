# Prompt Engineering Guidelines for AI Phone Agents

This guide explains the key principles of writing effective prompts for AI phone agents. A well-written prompt ensures your agent sounds natural, stays on task, and delivers a positive user experience.

## 1. Start with a Greeting

Begin the prompt with a simple, friendly greeting to set the tone.

Examples:
- Hi, this is John from [Company Name].
- Hello, you’re speaking with our support team.

## 2. Define the Agent's Role and Objective

Clearly state the agent’s function at the start.

Examples:
- You are a friendly and proactive sales agent. Your goal is to book a demo call with the person you're talking to.

Be specific about the goal and behavior expected.

## 3. Prompting Styles: Direct vs. Indirect

There are two ways to instruct the AI.

**Direct prompting**: Specify the exact sentence to say.

Example:
Say: “Have you eaten today?”

**Indirect prompting**: Describe the intention, allowing the AI to generate phrasing.

Example:
Ask the user if they’ve eaten today.

Recommendation: Combine both methods. Use direct prompting for critical lines, and indirect for natural dialogue.

## 4. Scripted vs. Freeform Conversations

If the agent must follow a strict script, include this instruction:

Follow the structure and order of the questions strictly and sequentially.

If you prefer more natural, adaptive conversations, omit this instruction.

## 5. Use Filler Words for Natural Speech

To make speech sound human, add the following instruction:

For the conversation to sound natural, use words like: uh, um, ehm, hmm, ahm, like, well, you know, etc.

Use them sparingly to avoid excessive hesitation.

## 6. Mark Where the Script Continues

After the greeting, tell the AI where to start the main part of the prompt:

[after the initial greeting, continue from here]

## 7. Avoid Bullet Lists in Prompts

Instead of formatting items like this:

- Great quality  
- Flexible payments  
- 30-day guarantee

Use a single sentence:

Great quality, flexible payments, 30-day guarantee

This makes the speech more fluid and natural.

## 8. Handle Phrases Like “Perfect” or “I’m Sorry” Carefully

AI agents often overuse certain responses. Adjust the prompt to handle this.

Example:
Instead of saying “Perfect” repeatedly, use:
Respond with phrases like 'Okay, thanks for letting me know' or 'Alright, that makes sense' based on the context.

If needed, also include:
Avoid repeating 'I’m sorry' or 'I’m sorry for the confusion'; use more context-aware acknowledgments instead.

## 9. Add Pauses When Needed

To ensure the agent gives users time to speak, insert:

[wait for user response]

This prevents the AI from talking over the user.

## 10. Handling Rejections and Negative Scenarios

Define how the agent should respond when the user says “No” or expresses disinterest.

Example:
If the user says they're not interested in booking, respond by asking if they’d prefer more information by email instead. If they refuse again, then politely end the call.

## 11. Remove Non-Actionable Personality Traits

Avoid vague statements like:

You’re a thoughtful agent who stays calm.

Instead, use clear behavioral instructions:

If the user gives negative feedback or says the price is too high, acknowledge their concern and explain why our solution offers a high return on investment.

## 12. Fix Mispronunciations

If the agent mispronounces names or domains, spell them out phonetically.

Example:
Instead of:
You are calling from win4life.com

Use:
You are calling from win for life dot com  
or  
You are calling from win-for-life dot com

This improves clarity.

## Final Notes

Prompt engineering is critical to AI agent performance. The prompt defines behavior, tone, and intelligence. When structured correctly, it creates meaningful and human-like conversations.
