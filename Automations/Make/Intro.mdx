# Automating AI Calls with GoHighLevel, Make.com, and Callin.io

This guide explains how to create a fully automated system that connects **GoHighLevel**, **Make.com**, and **Callin.io**. The goal is to automatically initiate a phone call with an AI agent when a contact is created in GoHighLevel, receive the transcription of the call, and update the contact record in GHL without any manual intervention.

## Step 1: Triggering the Workflow in GoHighLevel

The automation begins in GoHighLevel using a **Workflow**. This workflow should include:

- **Trigger**: `Contact Created`  
  This ensures that the process begins any time a new contact is added—whether manually, through a form, or via integration.

- **Action**: `Webhook`  
  This step sends the contact's data (such as name, phone number, or email) to a Webhook URL in Make.com. The phone number must be valid, as it will be used to initiate the AI call.

## Step 2: Scenario in Make.com

In Make.com, you will build a scenario with the following logic:

1. **Webhook Module**  
   This is the entry point of the scenario. It receives the data sent by GoHighLevel and parses the necessary contact details.

2. **(Optional) Number Validation**  
   You can add a module to format or validate the phone number before passing it to Callin.io.

3. **Callin.io – Activate Task**  
   This module starts the AI phone call by triggering a predefined task in Callin.io. The AI agent will handle the call based on the configuration defined in that task. Once the call is completed, Callin.io will send the transcription to a second webhook.

## Step 3: Configuring the Task in Callin.io

In your Callin.io dashboard, make sure the task includes the following:

- **Callback Webhook (Make)**  
  This webhook is where Callin.io sends the transcription and metadata once the AI call has finished.

- **Optional Task Settings**:
  - Answering machine detection
  - Retry logic (number of retries and interval)
  - Background audio

These options help ensure that calls are delivered effectively and reliably.

## Step 4: Receiving Transcription and Updating GHL

The second half of the Make.com scenario is triggered by the webhook that Callin.io calls after completing the call. This part includes:

1. **Receiving the Transcription**  
   The webhook captures the transcribed text and related data.

2. **Searching the Contact in GHL**  
   Use the `Search Contact` module to locate the original contact in GHL, typically using the phone number or email as an identifier.

3. **Updating the Contact**  
   Use the `Update Contact` module to insert the transcription into the contact’s record. You can store the transcription in a custom field, as a note, or log it as an activity.

## Final Result

You now have a complete automation that:

- Detects new contacts in GoHighLevel
- Launches AI calls through Callin.io
- Receives and processes transcriptions via Make.com
- Updates contact records in GHL automatically

This automation runs continuously in the background, saving time and ensuring every interaction is logged and actionable.
